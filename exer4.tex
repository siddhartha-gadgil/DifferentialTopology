\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-z^2$. For $c\in \R$ a fixed number, let
  $M_c=f^{-1}(c)$. Show that for $c\neq 0$ the set $M_c$ is a manifold.

\item For $c<0$ show that $M_c$ consists of two components, each of
  which is diffeomorphic to $\R^2$

\item For $c>0$, show that $M_c$ is diffeomorphic to the cylinder
  $S^1\times \R\subset \R^3$, given by $\{(x,y,z)\in\R^3:
  x^2+y^2=1\}$.

\item For $c=0$ show that $M_c$ is not a smooth manifold.

\item Let $M\subset \R^k$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold. Show
that the the subset $T(M)$ of $R^{2k}=R^k\times R^k$ given by
$$T(M)=\{(x,y):x\in M, y\in T_x M\}$$ 
is a smooth manifold.

\item Let $M\subset \R^k$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth manifold. Show
that the subset $N(M)$ of $R^{2k}=R^k\times R^k$ given by
$$N(M)=\{(x,y):x\in M, y\perp T_x M\}$$
is a smooth manifold.

\item Consider the set $X\subset\R^2$ given by 
$$X=\{(x,y)\in \R^2: y^2=x^3\}.$$
Show that $X$ is homeomorphic to $\R$.

\item Let $(x(s),y(s)):(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to X$ be a smooth curve
  with $x(0)=y(0)=0$. Show that $3x^2\cdot x'(s)=2y\cdot y'(s)$ and
  deduce that $y'(0)=0$.

\item Derive a similar relation involving $x'(s)$, $y'(s)$, $x''(s)$
  and $y''(s)$ and deduce that $x'(0)=0$.

\item Deduce that $X$ is not a $1$-dimensional manifold.

\item Show that $X$ is not diffeomorphic to $\R$.
