\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $V$ and $W$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces and $L:V\to W$ be a linear map. Show that $L$ is surjective if and only if there is a subspace $V'\subset V$ such that $L\vert_{V'}:V'\to W$ is invertible.

\item Deduce that the set of surjective linear maps from $V$ to $W$ is an open subset of the set of linear maps $Gl(V,W)$. Here the topology on $Gl(V,W)$ is given by identifying linear maps with matrices with respect to fixed bases on $V$ and $W$.

\item Deduce that for a smooth map $f:M\to N$ between smooth manifolds, the set of \textit{regular points} of $f$ is  open.

\item Given a smooth map $f:M\to N$ between compact smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$, is it necessarily true that the set of \emph{regular values} is open?

\item Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. For bases $B=\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$ and $B'=\{v'_1,\dots, v'_n\}$ of $V$, we define $B\sim B'$ if the matrix $A$ satisfying $A(v_i)=v_i'\ \forall i$ has positive determinant. Show that $\sim$ gives an equivalence relation on the set of bases of $V$.

\item Show that there are exactly two equivalence classes for the relation $\sim$.

\item A choice of equivalence class on $V$ is called an $\emph{orientation}$ of $V$. Show that orientations of vector spaces $V$ and $W$ induce a well-defined orientation of $V\oplus W$.

\item Show that if $V\subset W$ is a subspace of $W$ and $V'$ is a complementary space, then orientations on $V$ and $W$ induce a well-defined orientation on $V'$.
